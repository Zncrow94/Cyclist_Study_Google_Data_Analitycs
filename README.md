Task description

Source: Cyclistic-Case-Study-Task-Description

Cyclistic is a successful bike-share offering with the fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. It offers various pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The clear goal has been set: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The main task is to analyse the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
